										<h1>My Experience</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>With a solid foundation in data science and statistics, I have had the opportunity to explore a diverse range of applications across various fields, including aerospace technology, biofarming, criminal investigations, and marketing analysis. While my undergraduate education laid a solid groundwork, the real growth came from the opportunities outside of the classroom. Working in dynamic, innovative environments that embrace curiosity and encourage experimenting with new approaches has fueled my passion and allowed me to continuously evolve both personally and professionally. I thrive on developing data-driven solutions and leveraging machine learning innovation to solve interesting problems. These experiences have been incredibly rewarding and have deepened my appreciation for what I do.</p>

									<h3>One of my favorite projects at Interstellar Lab...</h3>
									<p>
										One of my favorite projects at Interstellar Lab was when I got to design an alert system to detect water stress in plants based on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) patterns, which is currently being integrated into the BioPod Model One for testing and eventual deployment in the upcoming Model Orion. 
										Working independently and without a budget, I built a full image processing pipeline that corrects lighting inconsistencies, extracts near-infrared and red light channels, and calculates pixel-level NDVI values. The system segments images to isolate plant regions, divides them according to the irrigation system layout, and analyzes NDVI trends by comparing the first value of the day to the previous day's final value. 
										When patterns suggesting water stress emerge, an automated alert is sent to the team via an API I developed, enabling timely interventions.

									<h3>The most challenging pipeline I worked on...</h3>
									<p>The most complex pipeline I've worked on involved designing and coding a physics-based simulation for the next-generation BioPod at Interstellar Lab, where I developed the machine learning models that powered its autonomous decision-making system. This was implemented in Python using object-oriented programming principles. As the simulation ran, it displayed hourly predictions while tracking estimated energy consumption, which was determined through collaboration with research engineers to understand the energy usage patterns of each individual component. By analyzing historical weather data alongside data from the previous BioPod model, I identified trends that revealed how external temperature influenced internal conditions and, in turn, energy consumption. This analysis aimed to optimize energy efficiency and contribute to a more sustainable design. By developing a simulation of the new BioPod and an interface to adjust the starting conditions, we were able to assess the system's response to sensor triggers and its ability to adapt accordingly. This work was incredibly difficult and taught me a lot, but it was a highly rewarding experience that played a critical role in enabling full autonomy for the next iteration of the BioPod.</p>
